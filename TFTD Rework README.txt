UFO & TFTD REWORK
by R Kallisti (aka Orz, Illamasqua)

WHAT THIS IS
Vanilla sundae with a cherry on top. Basically, a more "tasty" vanilla game. Improved, rebalanced & expanded: offers a slightly more challenging and immersive game experience while keeping the original vanilla flavour intact.

MAJOR CHANGES:

>> Alien Containment no longer available from the start (requires research).

>> Start off with Medikit & Scanner/Sensor.

>> All weapons/equipment rebalanced. TFTD underwater-only weapons now work on land.

>> New alien races: Floaters replaced by Waspites and Snakemen by Gazers. Also, TFTD got 5th alien race (on par with UFO/EU's Ethereals): Cephalids.

>> Mixed crews of alien races towards late game. 

>> Live alien research ("interrogations") reworked. 

>> Air combat/interception rebalanced.

>> LIGHTNING/HAMMERHEAD enhanced in terms of size/troop capacity and can now carry HWP/SWS.

>> Armors now require certain item prerequisite (or shall I say, corpse) before research may be properly unlocked. 

>> Mag-Ion Armor now flies on land. In essence, made TFTD and UFO/EU armors more like each other. 

>> Practically all recoverable items (alien weapons, UFO components) have sell prices halved. 

>> In terms of difficulty level, UFO/EU was brought up to TFTD's slightly harder standards. Conversely, TFTD was made just a tiny little bit easier (or less tedious?) in some areas.

>> Final missions almost completely redesigned. This is especially true of Cydonia, but T'leth got a little improvement in terms of challenge also. New enemy types also added for final mission only. 

>> Couple aesthetic reskins here and there (mostly for UFO/EU weaponry, particularly the Laser line; but TFTD got a couple too like Tasoth's reskin from yellow to teal).

>> Starting Base layout rearranged. 

>> Some nerfs on Soldier/Aquanaut stats (for caps, mostly). 

>> Re-reviewed all aliens (including terror units) stats, armors & damage modifiers. They still play/feel, in essence, the same as vanilla, just better.

Notes on UFO hull penetration: 
U_BITS.MCD and U_EXT02.MCD (TERRAIN folder) make UFOs completely sealed against blasts from rockets or explosives. If you do not want those MCD files simply delete them and restart OpenXcom and you get vanilla settings.
